# Introduction (Under construction)

Hello there, and welcome to my website. I am a technical writer, editor, illustrator, artist, and musician with a background in the biological sciences and computer documentation. I currently work in the marketing department of Resolvit in Raleigh, North Carolina where I write white papers and other documents using the latest technology. Please look around, and let me know if you would like to connect. 

Cheers,

Dorian Henderson

# Introduction

Hello there, and welcome to my website. I am a technical writer, editor, illustrator, artist, and musician with a background in the biological sciences and computer documentation. I currently work in the publications department of NetApp Inc. in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina where I edit, illustrate, and publish documentation using the latest technology. Please look around, and let me know if you would like to connect.

Cheers,

Dorian Henderson
